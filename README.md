# ATP Campaign Site Platform

**Version:** 3.1.0
**By:** Mirror Factory / ROI Amplified
**For:** America Tracking Polls (ATP)

---

## What This Is

A WordPress plugin system that generates complete campaign websites from a structured intake form. ATP staff fill out a 16-step form about a political candidate, the form produces a V3 JSON file, and that JSON drives the generation of a 7-page campaign website — homepage, issues, donate, contact, about, privacy policy, and cookie/SMS compliance policy.

The system is built as a monorepo that manages multiple client sites from one codebase. Each client gets a self-contained WordPress plugin that can run independently.

---

## The Parties

| Who | Role |
|-----|------|
| **America Tracking Polls (ATP)** | The political services company. Sells campaign websites + services to candidates. |
| **Mirror Factory** | The vendor. Builds and maintains the websites using this system. |
| **Candidate** | The end client. Gets a campaign website. Interacts with ATP, not Mirror Factory. |

## The Flow

```
ATP staff talks to candidate
        ↓
ATP fills out 16-step intake form (internal tool on ATP's WordPress)
        ↓
Form saves to ATP's database + uploads assets to Google Drive
        ↓
ATP clicks "Submit to Mirror Factory"
        ↓
Mirror Factory receives:
  - Email notification with candidate summary

        ↓
Mirror Factory runs JSON through AI generation prompt
        ↓
AI generates Page JSON (HTML for each shortcode section)

## The Intake Form (V3)

### Overview

### Steps

| Step | Section | Key Fields |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1/16 | Source Check | Who's filling this out, filing URL, Ballotpedia URL |
| 2/16 | Identity & Race | Legal name, display name, office, district, state, party, election date |
| 3/16 | Campaign Contact | Primary contact, campaign manager, treasurer (name/email/phone) |
| 4/16 | Bio & Messaging | Homepage intro, full bio, why running, tagline, key messages, endorsements |
| 5/16 | Platform & Issues | Up to 5 issue categories with positions |
| 6/16 | Background | Profession, education (3 slots), military service |
| 7/16 | Visual Branding | Headshot upload, logo upload, photos, brand colors, visual style |
| 8/16 | Social Media | Facebook, X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn |
| 9/16 | Video | Campaign video URL |

| 14/16 | Approval & Timeline | Content approver, launch timeline, communication preference |
| 15/16 | Grow Beyond Your Website | Additional services interest, Tier 2 pages, survey upsells |
| 16/16 | Summary & Acknowledgment | Review all data, confirm scope, generate profile |

### Output

The form outputs a nested V3 JSON with 17 sections. See `v3-schema.json` for the complete empty schema and `v3-field-map.json` for the mapping between form field IDs and JSON paths.

## The JSON-to-Site Pipeline

### How the JSON becomes a website

1. **Intake form produces V3 JSON** — all candidate data in one structured file
2. **AI reads the JSON + prompt template** — `PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md` tells the AI how to generate HTML for each shortcode section
3. **AI outputs Page JSON** — each key is a shortcode tag, each value is production HTML
4. **Page JSON imported into WordPress** — ATP Shortcodes → Candidate Page → paste → import
5. **Legal pages auto-populated** — privacy and cookie policy templates have `[bracket]` variables replaced from `legal_compliance.*`
6. **Media imported from Drive** — headshot, logo, photos downloaded into WP media library
7. **Site renders** — each page is a list of shortcode tags, each shortcode renders its HTML from the database

### What's automatic vs manual

| Step | Automatic | Manual |
|------|-----------|--------|
| JSON generation from form | Yes | — |
| File upload to Drive/WP | Yes | — |
| AI page generation | Could be automated | Currently: paste JSON into prompt |
| Page JSON import | One-click in admin | — |
| Legal page variable replacement | In the prompt | — |
| Domain + SSL setup | — | SiteGround admin |
| White label branding | Auto from site-config.json | — |

## Plugin Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shortcode Editor** | Edit any section's HTML in the admin. Database edits override plugin defaults. |
| **Page Importer** | One-click creation of all 7 pages with Canvas template and SEO metadata. |
| **Candidate Page Engine** | Import Page JSON from AI. Each key populates a shortcode. |
| **White Label** | Custom login page, admin bar, dashboard, footer — all from settings. |
| **File Upload** | Native drag-and-drop upload. WordPress media (default) or Google Drive. |
| **Setup Wizard** | First-run onboarding. Restartable from admin menu. |
| **Auto-Updater** | Checks GitHub for new releases, updates plugin automatically. |
| **Site Config** | `site-config.json` auto-applies client branding on activation. |

---

## Monorepo Operations

### Add a new client

```bash
./scripts/new-site.sh client-slug "Client Name" "Office Tagline"
# Edit sites/client-slug/site-config.json
# Save intake JSON to sites/client-slug/intake-v3.json
```

### Build a client's plugin

```bash
./scripts/build-site.sh client-slug
# Output: dist/client-slug/atp-campaign-site/
# Zip and deploy to their WordPress
```

### Update all clients

Edit `packages/atp-plugin-core/` → commit → tag → GitHub Action builds all client plugins.

### Give a client their site

Zip `dist/client-slug/atp-campaign-site/` — it's a self-contained WordPress plugin. No dependency on the monorepo, Mirror Factory, or ATP.

---

## Post-Launch Editing

### How edits work

The shortcode system has two layers:

1. **Registry defaults** — template HTML in `registry.php`
2. **Database edits** — changes made in the shortcode editor

Database always wins. Plugin updates change defaults, never database content. "Reset" button reverts to the latest default.

### Edit workflow

1. ATP meets with candidate, collects feedback
2. ATP sends consolidated document to Mirror Factory (screenshots + edit descriptions)
3. Mirror Factory edits shortcodes in admin or re-generates via AI
4. Changes go live immediately

### Scope tracking

Edits within the 7-page Standard package are included. Additional pages, features, or services are quoted separately. The intake form's "Grow Beyond Your Website" section captures interest signals for upsells.
